# Introduction
In I Lost My Limbs you have to traverse the halls of the Greek Statue museum, strategically swapping limbs to restore the statue of Aphrodite, all while avoiding observant guards. But, the clock is ticking, as the museum's grand reopening approaches

This was a project I made for the course Game Design 2. This is not a part of Game Development at DAE, but I wanted to take this as an extra course to improve my game design skills and because I really enjoy coming up with new ideas. For the assignment, we had to prototype and iterate an idea that was inspired by a trip to a museum.
# Goal
From the start, i really wanted to make a stealth game. I was thinking about stealing something out of the museum, but I felt like that wasn't super special. I wanted to make something more unique, a mechanic that hadn't been seen before. At the beginning of my brainstorm, it was a bit hard to come up with an idea that I was really happy with. So I decided to go over the pictures that I had from the museum, to get more inspiration. I realised that most statues aren't complete, almost every statue has limbs missing. That gave me a new wave of ideas, I brainstormed around them and managed to come up with the limb swap idea.
# Story
The Greek Statue Museum recently moved places and is reopening soon. In order to move all the statues they had to cut off all their limbs. Unfortunately, they messed up the limbs of the goddess Aphrodite. They are scattered around the museum. Of course, she isn't happy with that, so she decides that action needs to be taken.
