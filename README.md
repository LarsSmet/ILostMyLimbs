 # Introduction
In I Lost My Limbs you have to traverse the halls of the Greek Statue museum, strategically swapping limbs to restore the statue of Aphrodite, all while avoiding observant guards. But, the clock is ticking, as the museum's grand reopening approaches

This was a project I made for the course Game Design 2. This is not a part of Game Development at DAE, but I wanted to take this as an extra course to improve my game design skills and because I really enjoy coming up with new ideas. For the assignment, we had to prototype and iterate an idea that was inspired by a trip to a museum.
# Goal
From the start, i really wanted to make a stealth game. I was thinking about stealing something out of the museum, but I felt like that wasn't super special. I wanted to make something more unique, a mechanic that hadn't been seen before. At the beginning of my brainstorm, it was a bit hard to come up with an idea that I was really happy with. So I decided to go over the pictures that I had from the museum, to get more inspiration. I realised that most statues aren't complete, almost every statue has limbs missing. That gave me a new wave of ideas, I brainstormed around them and managed to come up with the limb swap idea.
# Story
The Greek Statue Museum recently moved places and is reopening soon. In order to move all the statues they had to cut off all their limbs. Unfortunately, they messed up the limbs of the goddess Aphrodite. They are scattered around the museum. Of course, she isn't happy with that, so she decides that action needs to be taken.
# Gameplay and mechanics
## Guards
There are guards walking around the museum, if they spot you, you lose.
## Limb swap
The main mechanic of the game is swapping limbs. If you are a limb, you can only go onto statues that have that limb missing. If you become a statue you attach the limb to that statue. If you are a statue, you can't be seen by the guards. To go off the statue, you have to become a limb again, you can only become one of the limbs that the statue has. 
## Restoring the statue of Aphrodite
The goal of the game is to complete the statue of Aphrodite. You have to find her limbs in the museum and put them on her statue to win.

## Time until opening
The museum opens soon, so there is a timer in the game. This puts some healthy pressure on the player and it makes the game a lot more fun. 
# Improvements and what's next
I think with some cool visuals this game could be awesome. In terms of gameplay improvements, I would improve the way that you select a limb. Right now you have the bumper and trigger buttons to swap. But I think it would be better if this would be replaced by using a stick to select one. It would be a lot more clear and accidentally swapping to the wrong limb would happen less. Right now it is also a prototype level, so the level design isn't perfect, but there are definitely a lot of level ideas that can be explored that can help increase the puzzle aspect of the game. There is a really nice part of the level that already showcases this potential on the right.
